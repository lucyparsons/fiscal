# Lucy Parsons Labs Fiscal Information

### About

At Lucy Parsons Labs we hold ourselves to a higher standard to be as transparent and radical as possible, and to do so we made a conscious decision to carry that over into our finances. 

This repository will hold a public and complete copy of our finances available to anyone to review at anytime. This repository will be updated weekly with all current information on all aspects of money in and out of LPL.

Lucy Parsons Labs is a registered 501(c)3 Chicago-based non-profit collaboration between data scientists, transparency activists, and technologists which focuses on the intersection of digital rights and on-the-streets issues.
